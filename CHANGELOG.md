### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: v0.4.0 Feature Restoration (Phase 1 - Data Pipeline)
- **Restored 1,382 lines** accidentally deleted from `csv_to_json.py` in commit f62acee (Nov 8, 2025)
- **Root cause**: Commit overwrote file, removing core v0.4.0 functionality
- **Features restored**:
  - Widget processing (~350 lines): accordion, carousel, tabs with Bootstrap HTML generation
  - IIIF metadata auto-population (~400 lines): extracts title, creator, period, location, credit
  - Glossary auto-linking (~150 lines): `[[term_id]]` syntax processing
  - Multilingual support (~100 lines): language string loading and interpolation
- **Applied v0.5.0 updates** to restored code (version header, flattened image paths)

#### CRITICAL: v0.4.0 Feature Restoration (Phase 2 - Display Components)
- **Restored frontend components** for widgets and glossary (~115 lines total)
- **Widget panel-specific styling**: Layer 1 widgets use Layer 2 colors and vice versa
- **Enhanced glossary functionality**: Proper title extraction, both inline and index links work
- **Widget initialization**: Added widgets.js script tag
- **Glossary multilingual support**: Language-aware panel labels and "Key term:" prefix

#### Layer 2 Panel Heading Colors
- **Fixed h2, h3, h4 color inheritance** in layer 2 panels (white on dark purple background)

#### Glossary Warning Message Clarity
- **Improved error message formatting** for missing glossary terms with quoted, bold term IDs
- **Added file path context** showing exactly which markdown file contains the broken reference
- **Natural sentence structure** replaces technical phrasing for better readability
- **Example**: "In the file stories/story2/step4-layer2.md, you reference the glossary term 'term', but this term does not exist in components/texts/glossary/"
- Files modified: `scripts/csv_to_json.py`, `_data/languages/en.yml`, `_data/languages/es.yml`

### Migration

- **Automated v0.4.x → v0.5.0 migration**:
  - File relocation: old subdirectories → `components/images/`
  - CSV column update: `iiif_manifest` → `source_url`
  - Name conflict detection and empty directory cleanup
- **Full backward compatibility**: No breaking changes for existing sites

## [0.4.3-beta] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed

#### v0.4.1 Migration Script Comment Restoration
- **Complete framework comments restored**: Migration now restores all missing comments in _config.yml
- **Top header comments**: Framework title and GitHub URL now restored at file beginning
- **Complete testing-features section**: Entire section created if missing (not just comments)
- **Impact**: Sites upgrading from v0.3.4 through multiple versions now have complete config structure
- Files modified: `scripts/migrations/v040_to_v041.py`

#### iPad Touch Scrolling for Story Navigation
- **Touch navigation support**: iPad and touch devices can now navigate stories using swipe gestures
- **Desktop viewport mode**: Fixes issue where touch scrolling didn't trigger story step changes
- **Swipe to navigate**: Swipe up for next step, swipe down for previous step
- **Respects cooldowns**: Same 600ms cooldown as mouse/trackpad scrolling
- Files modified: `assets/js/story.js` (added touch event handlers)

#### IIIF Regeneration on Config Changes
- **Automatic regeneration**: IIIF tiles now regenerate when _config.yml changes
- **Prevents broken images**: Fixes issue where baseurl changes caused image serving failures

- Thanks to Tara for reporting this issue
- Files modified: `.github/workflows/build.yml` (updated change detection pattern)

#### EXIF Orientation Handling in IIIF Generation
- **Portrait photos now display correctly**: Images from phones/cameras no longer appear rotated 90 degrees
- **EXIF metadata respected**: Script now applies EXIF orientation data before generating IIIF tiles
- **User experience**: Students can upload phone photos directly without manual rotation
- **Visual feedback**: Console displays "↻ Applied EXIF orientation correction" when rotation is applied
- Thanks to Tara for helping spot this issue
- Files modified: `scripts/generate_iiif.py` (both `generate_iiif_for_image()` and `copy_base_image()`)

---

## [0.4.2-beta] - 2025-11-09

### Added

#### Smart IIIF Change Detection
- **Automatic optimization**: Build workflow now intelligently detects when IIIF tile regeneration is needed
- **Git diff-based detection**: Compares changed files between commits to determine if images or objects.csv changed
- **Manual override**: Workflow dispatch includes "Force IIIF tile regeneration" checkbox (default: checked for safety)
- **Multiple failsafes**: Defaults to full build on first commit, detection errors, or uncertain cases
- **GitHub Actions caching**: IIIF tiles cached between builds to prevent deletion when skipping regeneration
- **Cache key strategy**: Automatically invalidates cache when image files change using hash-based keys
- **Time savings**: Faster deployments for content-only changes (stories, text, metadata)
- **User experience**: Silent optimization for automatic builds, explicit control for manual triggers

**How it works**:
- Automatic builds (push to main): Detects file changes, skips IIIF if only content changed
- Manual builds: User checkbox to skip IIIF regeneration (safe default always regenerates)
- Cache system: Tiles saved after generation, restored when skipping, automatically invalidated on image changes

**Technical details**:
- Detection step runs before IIIF generation
- Checks `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD` for changed files
- Triggers IIIF when: images in `components/images/objects/` or `objects.csv` changed
- Skips IIIF when: Only content files changed (stories, glossary, configs, layouts, etc.)
- Cache operations: restore → generate (if needed) → save → restore to _site (if skipped)

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: IIIF Tile Deletion When Skipping Regeneration
- **Root cause identified**: GitHub Actions workflows are ephemeral - each run starts fresh with no IIIF tiles
- **Problem**: Skipping IIIF generation left `_site/iiif/objects/` empty, deployment replaced entire site, deleting live tiles
- **Solution**: GitHub Actions cache system preserves tiles between workflow runs
- **Cache strategy**:
  - Restore cache after Jekyll build
  - Generate and cache tiles (if needed)
  - Restore cached tiles to `_site/` when skipping regeneration
  - Cache key based on image directory hash for automatic invalidation
- **Safety features**: Warns if cache unavailable, logs all cache operations, fails gracefully
- **Testing**: Confirmed working on demo site (ampl.clair.ucsb.edu/telar)
- **Impact**: Critical fix prevents tile deletion, enables safe optimization

#### Mobile Navbar Title Wrapping
- Long site titles now wrap naturally on mobile devices instead of overflowing or being cut off
- Hamburger menu right-aligned for better mobile UX
- Flexbox properties adjusted for proper text flow on small screens

#### Mobile Font Size Adjustments
- Added `white-space: normal` to allow proper text wrapping
- Reduced display-4 font size on mobile for better readability
- Works in conjunction with existing height-based responsive design

#### Site Title Wrapping on Mobile
- CSS rules added to enable proper text wrapping for site titles
- Ensures titles display cleanly across all mobile screen sizes
- Tested with various title lengths on different devices

#### Site Description Link Styling
- Fixed link styling on home page for consistent appearance
- Proper theme color application to site description links

### Changed
- Build workflow now includes smart IIIF detection and caching (4 new steps, ~76 lines added)
- Migration framework updated with `README.md` and `index.html` for complete v0.4.1 upgrades

## [0.4.1-beta] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: Upgrade Script Comment Deletion
- **Migration script bug fixed**: v0.3.4→v0.4.0 migration was deleting ALL comments from `_config.yml`
- **GitHub Actions workflow bug fixed**: Workflow was using `yaml.dump()` which stripped all comments after migration
- **Comment restoration added**: v0.4.0→v0.4.1 migration now detects and restores 13 types of missing comments
- **Comments restored**: Site Settings, Story Interface, PLEASE DO NOT EDIT warning, Collections, Build Settings, Defaults, Telar Settings, Plugins, WEBrick, Development & Testing, Christmas Tree Mode, and all setup instructions
- Root cause: `_ensure_google_sheets_comments()` in v034_to_v040.py used destructive `while loop + pop()` pattern
- Secondary cause: Workflow step "Update version in _config.yml" used `yaml.safe_load()` + `yaml.dump()` after migrations
- Impact: Users upgrading from v0.3.4 to v0.4.0 lost all documentation in their config files
- **Note for users**: After upgrading to v0.4.1, you need to update your `.github/workflows/upgrade.yml` file ONCE (see upgrade instructions)

#### CRITICAL: Mobile Responsive Features Restored
- **Complete mobile code recovery**: Restored ~1,300 lines of mobile responsive code accidentally lost in v0.4.0 release
- **Height-based responsive design**: 4-tier progressive system for small screens (Tiers 1-3: 700px, 667px, 600px height breakpoints)
- **Mobile panel UI**: Fixed-size panels with stacking visibility and proper viewport positioning
- **Graceful panel transitions**: Navigation cooldown, skeleton shimmer loading, fade-only transitions on mobile
- **Mobile preloading**: Aggressive ±2 step preloading on mobile, enhanced 3/2 forward/backward on desktop
- **Offcanvas adjustments**: Progressive typography and spacing reductions for small screens
- **Site-wide scaling**: Consistent mobile experience across all pages
- Root cause: Upstream merge in commit f62acee overwrote local mobile development
- Impact: Major regression fix - restores complete mobile UX from v0.4.0

### Added

#### Object Gallery Mobile Layout
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Single column layout up to 441px width, two columns from 442px-768px
- **Explicit column control**: Replaced auto-fill grid behavior with explicit column counts for predictable mobile layout
- **iPhone Pro Max optimization**: 440px width devices display single column for optimal readability
- **Removed conflicting rules**: Fixed 576px media query that was overriding mobile breakpoints

#### Coordinate Picker Improvements
- **Sheets copy button**: New button in coordinate picker that copies tab-separated values (x\ty\tzoom) for direct pasting into Google Sheets
- **CSV copy button**: Renamed existing button to "x, y, zoom (CSV)" for clarity
- **Button order**: Sheets button first (primary workflow), CSV button second
- **Multilingual support**: Button labels and "Copied!" feedback respect `telar_language` setting
- Both buttons provide visual feedback ("Copied!" / "¡Copiado!")

### Changed
- Coordinate picker now has two copy buttons instead of one, with clear labels indicating format
- Coordinate picker buttons are now fully multilingual (English/Spanish)

  - Automatic version detection from `_config.yml`
  - Incremental migration support (v0.2.0 → v0.3.0 → v0.3.1 → v0.3.2 → v0.3.3 → v0.3.4)
  - Automatic upgrade branch and issue creation with categorized summary
  - User creates pull request manually from issue link when ready to merge
  - Conditional manual steps section (only shown if steps required)
  - Verification checklist for post-upgrade testing
  - **v020_to_v030 migration**: Fetches Python scripts from GitHub to ensure sites receive validation logic for IIIF manifests, thumbnails, and object references
  - **v033_to_v034 migration**: Adds missing framework files (`README.md`, `docs/README.md`, layouts, includes, scripts) to ensure all sites receive updated files

- **Language configuration (WIP)**: New `telar_language` setting in `_config.yml` for future internationalization support
  - Currently supports: `en` (English), `es` (Spanish)
  - Default value: `en`
  - Migration script automatically adds this field when upgrading from earlier versions
  - **Note**: Internationalization features are work in progress; this configuration prepares sites for future multi-language support

### Fixed

- **Validation alert styling**: Fixed inconsistent styling between IIIF URL warning and upgrade success alert
  - Added `font-weight: 400 !important` to `.telar-alert` CSS class to prevent lighter font weight inheritance from `.page-content` wrapper
  - Ensures all validation warnings (theme, Google Sheets, objects, stories, IIIF URL, upgrade) display with consistent typography regardless of HTML placement

## [0.3.3-beta] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed

- **GitHub Actions workflow**: Removed git push step that conflicted with branch protection rules. The workflow was attempting to commit generated files back to the protected main branch, causing deployment failures. Generated files are build artifacts that don't need to be committed to the repository.

## [0.3.2-beta] - 2025-10-28

### Added

- **Image sizing in panel markdown**: New syntax `![alt](path){size}` for controlling image sizes in panel content
  - Supports both short (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `full`) and long (`small`, `medium`, `large`) size names
  - Default path for relative images: `/components/images/additional/`
  - Sizes: small (250px), medium (450px, default), large (700px), full-width (100%)
  - Absolute paths and URLs work as expected
  - Example: `![Description](image.jpg){large}` or `![Photo](/assets/photo.jpg){sm}`

### Changed

- **Default panel image size**: Increased from 300px to 450px max-width for better visibility
- **Scheduled builds removed**: Removed daily midnight cron job from build workflow. Builds now only trigger on push to main or manual workflow dispatch.
- **Index page refactored for easier customization**: Moved `index.html` to `_layouts/index.html` and created editable `index.md` in root directory
  - Users can now customize welcome message, stories heading, and objects section text in simple markdown
  - Demo site notice is now in markdown and easily removable
  - Support for `{count}` placeholder in objects intro text
  - Customizable via frontmatter: `stories_heading`, `stories_intro`, `objects_heading`, `objects_intro`

## [0.3.1-beta] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- **Critical thumbnail loading bug**: Fixed thumbnails not displaying on objects page due to empty string handling in Liquid templates. Objects with empty `thumbnail` or `iiif_manifest` values now properly fall through to appropriate fallback logic.
- **Local image viewer bug**: Fixed local images (self-hosted IIIF) not loading in object detail pages due to empty `iiif_manifest` string being treated as truthy in Liquid conditionals.
- **Objects gallery thumbnails**: Fixed local image thumbnails not loading in objects gallery by adding non-empty string checks to all `iiif_manifest` conditionals.

## [0.3.0-beta] - 2025-10-25

### Added

- **Google Sheets integration**: Config-based workflow supporting both GitHub Pages and local development. Users paste shared and published URLs into `_config.yml` for automatic GID discovery and CSV fetching. No GitHub Secrets required.
  - `fetch_google_sheets.py` script for local CSV fetching
  - `discover_sheet_gids.py` for automatic tab GID discovery from published sheets
  - Excel template with demo data at `docs/google_sheets_integration/telar-template.xlsx`
  - Google Sheets Template available and can easily be duplicated, at https://bit.ly/telar-template
  - Local development guide at `docs/google_sheets_integration/README.md`
  - **Instruction rows and columns**: Add notes and instructions directly in Google Sheets or CSVs that are automatically filtered out during processing
    - Rows starting with `#` are skipped (useful for section breaks, TODOs, and temporary comments)
    - Columns with names starting with `#` (e.g., `# Instructions`, `# Notes`) are ignored during JSON conversion
    - Template includes `# Instructions` column with examples for user guidance
- **Comprehensive error messaging system**: User-friendly warnings displayed on index, objects, and story pages when configuration issues are detected
- **Object ID validation**: Automatic stripping of file extensions from object IDs and warnings for spaces in filenames
- **IIIF manifest validation**: Full validation of external IIIF manifests with detailed error messages
- **Thumbnail validation**: Automatic detection and clearing of invalid thumbnail values (placeholders, non-image files)
- **Build-time warnings**: Console logging with structured [INFO] and [WARN] messages during CSV to JSON conversion
- **Index page issue summary**: Context-aware warnings that link directly to affected objects or stories
- **Objects gallery warnings**: Summary of all objects with configuration issues with links to details
- **Story intro warnings**: Display of configuration issues before users scroll, preventing confusion

- **Theme system**: Flexible theming system with 4 preset themes and support for custom themes
  - Preset themes: Paisajes Coloniales (default), Neogranadina, Santa Barbara, and Austin
  - Easy theme switching via `_config.yml` with single-line configuration
  - Customizable colors (primary, secondary, panel backgrounds) and fonts (headings, body)
  - Advanced users can create `_data/themes/custom.yml` for fully custom themes (gitignored by default)
  - Dynamic CSS generation using SCSS with Liquid templating

### Fixed

- **Orphaned file cleanup**: generate_collections.py now properly removes old files before generating new ones, preventing stale content

### Changed

- **Default content management**: Google Sheets is now the recommended default workflow, with CSV files as an optional alternative for users who prefer direct file editing
- **Error message clarity**: All user-facing errors reference "configuration CSV or Google Sheet" for clarity
- **Object warning field**: Added object_warning to Jekyll collection frontmatter for template access
- **Objects CSV column order**: Moved iiif_manifest to position 4 (after description) for better visibility and logical grouping
- **Story CSV column order**: Reordered columns to group related fields - object and coordinates (x, y, zoom) now appear at start after step number, followed by question/answer, then panel configuration
- **Story intro layout**: Intro slide now appears in the narrative column (left side) instead of full-screen, with step 1's viewer visible immediately on the right for a cleaner, more consistent experience
- **Glossary page styling**: Glossary term links now use theme link colors and body font for consistent theming
- **Glossary navigation**: Clicking glossary terms on the glossary index page now opens a slide-over panel instead of navigating to separate pages, providing a smoother browsing experience
  - Panels slide away and then back in when switching between terms for smooth transitions
  - Glossary panels are narrower than story layer 2 panels (45% vs 55%) for clear visual hierarchy
  - Back button added to glossary panel header for easy dismissal, matching story panel design
- **Theme fallback system**: Multi-tier protection against theme configuration errors
  - Three types of error detection: missing theme, malformed YAML, or critical system failure
  - Automatic fallback to paisajes (default) theme when configured theme is unavailable
  - Protected fallback copy in `scripts/defaults/themes/` as ultimate backup
  - Hardcoded CSS defaults ensure site functions even if all theme files are damaged
  - User-friendly warning messages on index page explain issues and suggest fixes

### Removed

- **Deprecated glossary CSV workflow**: Glossary feature now sources content exclusively from markdown files in `_glossary/`. CSV-based glossary input has been removed.
- **Non-functional project.csv fields**: Removed `primary_color`, `secondary_color`, `font_headings`, and `font_body` from `project.csv` (these values were not being used by templates). Theme customization now handled via the new theme system in `_data/themes/`.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2025-10-20

### Changed

- **Scrolling system overhaul**: Replaced Scrollama library with custom discrete step-based card stacking architecture to enable **multiple IIIF objects within a single story**. Each object gets its own preloaded viewer card that slides up/down as users navigate through steps.
- **Animation timing**: Reduced viewer pan/zoom animation duration from 36 seconds to 4 seconds for more natural pacing
- **Cleaner viewer UI**: Hidden UniversalViewer color picker and adjustment panels for distraction-free viewing

### Fixed

- **Critical navigation bug**: Fixed viewer cards getting stuck or invisible after backward→forward navigation cycles
- **Z-index layering**: Resolved issue where reused viewer cards appeared behind currently visible cards
- **State management**: Added complete state reset when reusing viewer cards (clears inline styles, transitions, opacity)
- **Intro handling**: Improved viewer reference management when navigating to/from story intro

### Added

- **Story 2 showcase**: Added comprehensive demo story with rich media examples (images, videos, markdown formatting)
- **Enhanced logging**: Improved console debugging messages for bounds checking and state transitions

## [0.1.1-beta] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- Fixed IIIF thumbnails loading at low resolution on home and objects pages by extracting 400px canvas images instead of tiny thumbnail properties
- Fixed markdown syntax not rendering in panels by adding markdown-to-HTML conversion in csv_to_json.py script
- Added comprehensive footnote styling for both panel layers with proper contrast and visual hierarchy
- Added markdown module to requirements.txt for GitHub Actions CI/CD compatibility
- Fixed image URLs in slide-over panels not working when site is deployed to subdirectories by automatically detecting and prepending the base URL

## [0.1.0-beta] - 2025-10-14
